# IMPORTANT!!!
## Start new Project:
After cloning the sample project you should first change the project name. This can be acieved by editing the "CMakeLists.txt" and changing the first argument in the project() call.

Example:

`project(MyProgram VERSION 0.1.0)` -> "MyProgram" becomes the Project Name

After this, you should call the ">CMake: Delete Cache and Reconfigure" function by pressing F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P and selecting the corresponding entry.
